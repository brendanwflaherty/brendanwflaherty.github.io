<p> Hello all! welcome to my first website!
  I am a Freshman studying at the University of Maine's Business school! I am from Acton, MA. Being in Maine is an exciting and new change of life for me, although it is still new england, Mass and Maine have some pretty big differences.
 I grew up playing many sports, such as Soccer, Track, and currently Rugby. I am a huge beleiver in fitness and health so it has become a pretty huge portion of my life.

<h3> Rugby: </h3>
<p>When I decided to no longer continue my track career here at Umaine I found myself very bored without a sport to play. So I signed myself up for a couple club sport and went to some practices but for some reaso I was drawn to rugby. I for some reason really enjoyed the agression of the sport and it felt like I had found a new sport to love, and I think I really do love it, I plan to continue playing in the spring season.
  Obviously rugby is a much more contact sport than I have ever been exposed to and I am still getting used to the bruises and pains that come with. Overall im very happy with my decision to explore a new sport because I found something really fun and exciting. </p>

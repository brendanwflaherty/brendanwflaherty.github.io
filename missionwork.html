<h3> Appalachian Service Project </h3>
<p> ASP is n organization dedicated to constructing homes for homeless people lving in the appalachian mountain range.
  Ever since my freshman year in highschool I have volenteered one week of my summer vacation to work with ASP along with a large group from my church.
  Every year it has been a great expierence and is a great way to gain new perspectives on the world we live in. In addition to that I get alot of contentness and feeling of purpose through helping others.

<h3> Soccer: </h3>
<p> The frist time a played Soccer was when I was about six years old, I instantly fell in love wiht the sport and it became my whole life for the next 12 years.
  I played on an average of two or three teams a year and played during all four seasons year round. My biggest success fator wasi typically could run the fastest on any team I played for.
  This talent alone is what helped me play at the levels of soccer I was playing at at, because to be honest I was not the best at the technnical part of the game. </p>
